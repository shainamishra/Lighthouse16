Lighthouse 16 is a point-and-click atmospheric puzzle game made using Phaser 3. In Tarot, the Tower card represents change, upheaval, and chaos. In this game, the player takes on the tower (in the form of a lighthouse) as a manifestation of their mounting anxiety surrounding a big change in their life. Players have to navigate the different puzzles in order to ascend the tower and face it head on.
