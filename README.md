Lighthouse 16 is a point-and-click horror puzzle game using Phaser 3. In Tarot, the Tower card represents change, upheaval, and chaos. In this game, the player takes on the tower (in the form of a lighthouse) as a manifestation of their mounting anxiety surrounding a big change in their life. Players have to navigate the different puzzles in order to ascend the tower and find what secrets lie inside.
